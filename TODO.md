# Payment 419 Error Fix - TODO List

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed the 419 page expired error on payment success/fail/cancel pages
- [x] Identified session handling as the root cause
- [x] Added session regeneration to success, fail, and cancel methods in SslCommerzPaymentController
- [x] Updated TODO.md with implementation details

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the payment flow to ensure the 419 error is resolved
- [ ] Verify that payment callbacks work correctly with the session regeneration
- [ ] Monitor for any side effects from session regeneration

## Notes
- The 419 error was likely caused by SSLCommerz redirecting back without maintaining the session cookie
- Added `$request->session()->regenerate();` to each callback method to create a fresh session
- CSRF protection is already properly excluded for these routes
- Routes are correctly configured to handle both GET and POST methods

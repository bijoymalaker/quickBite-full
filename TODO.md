# TODO: Integrate Success, Fail, and Cancel Pages with SslCommerz

## Current Status
- Backend integration is complete with SslCommerzPaymentController handling success, fail, cancel callbacks.
- Routes are defined for /success, /fail, /cancel.
- Vue pages (Success.vue, Fail.vue, Cancel.vue) are implemented and render order details or errors.
- Checkout.vue initiates payment by submitting to /pay.

## Tasks
- [x] Verify frontend flow and navigation for payment result pages.
- [x] Enhance error handling in Vue pages for cases where orderDetails is null.
- [x] Add loading state in Checkout.vue after payment submission.
- [x] Ensure consistent styling and user experience across payment pages.
- [ ] Test the full payment flow (simulate or check for potential issues).
- [x] Add any missing navigation links or redirects.

## Dependent Files
- resources/js/pages/payment/Success.vue
- resources/js/pages/payment/Fail.vue
- resources/js/pages/payment/Cancel.vue
- resources/js/pages/Checkout.vue
- app/Http/Controllers/SslCommerzPaymentController.php
- routes/web.php

## Followup Steps
- Run the application using `php artisan serve` and `npm run dev`.
- Navigate to /checkout, fill in details, select 'Online Transaction', and submit.
- This should redirect to SslCommerz gateway (sandbox if configured).
- After payment simulation, it should redirect back to /success, /fail, or /cancel.
- Check browser console for any errors.
- Verify that order status is updated in the database.
- Ensure Vue pages display correctly with order details or errors.
